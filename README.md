## Description

The goal of this application was to get familiar with Flutter - widgets, navigation and routing, and styling. There are three major screens (summary, sharing, and browsing) that allows users to review information about their daily activities. The Browse screen contains a wide list of categories such as body measurements, cycle tracking, and hearing.
